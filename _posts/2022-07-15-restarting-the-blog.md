Lots of change, it seemed like it was time to start a blog again. I was asked to start a technical blog again and
there's lots of other stuff that I should also start writing.

At this point, I'm really just trying to get some new infrastructure set up, so bear with me while I fight with jekyll
and github-pages. I let my old website (and hosting platform) lapse last time due to monetary cost and the time cost. In
the end, it was a double-loss for me. Maybe I'll be able to migrate some of the "good" posts into this new instance.
